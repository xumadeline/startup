[My Notes](docs/notes.md)

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration. -->

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Drinkly is a gamified water intake tracker that turns hydration into a daily streak game. Users log water with a single tap and watch their virtual tree grow with rain animations as they progress toward personalized hydration goals, earn fruit rewards for consistency, unlock new tree species, and compete with friends on a realtime leaderboard.

### Design

![Design image](docs/dashboard-mock.png)

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how users interact with the backend when logging water and updating the leaderboard.

    participant Database

    User->>Server: Log water intake
    Server->>Database: Store water log
    Server-->>User: Updated progress & rewards
    Server-->>Friend: Leaderboard update (WebSocket)
```

### Key features

- Secure user registration, login, and logout
- Personalized daily hydration goals
- One-tap water intake logging
- Animated tree growth and rain effects
- Streak tracking and fruit rewards
- Unlockable tree types based on consistency
- Weekly leaderboard
- Realtime updates using WebSockets
- Persistent storage of user and activity data
- Ability for admin to manage hydration facts

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** – Uses correct HTML structure for application pages including login, profile setup, dashboard, fruit basket, leaderboard, settings, and admin views.
- **CSS** – Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice, contrast, and includes animations for tree growth and rain effects.
- **React** – Provides login, water logging, progress display, leaderboard viewing, and routing using React components and React Router.
- **Service** – Backend service with endpoints for:
  - register
  - login
  - logout
  - logging water intake
  - retrieving daily intake totals
  - retrieving leaderboard data
  - managing fruit rewards and tree unlocks
- **DB/Login** – Stores users, authentication credentials, water logs, streaks, fruit inventory, and unlocked trees in a database. Users must be authenticated to log water.
- **WebSocket** – As users log water or complete daily goals, leaderboard updates and friend activity are broadcast to all other users in realtime.
- **Third-party API** – When a user reaches their daily hydration goal, the backend retrieves a motivational quote from the ZenQuotes public API and displays it as a reward.

- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - Notifications list showing friend activities on dashboard.

## 🚀 CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Visually appealing colors and layout. No overflowing elements.** - Used a consistent blue water theme with Bootstrap cards, clean header/footer, and no overflow issues across all pages.
- [x] **Use of a CSS framework** - Bootstrap 5 loaded via CDN on all four pages for components like progress bars, tables, and layout utilities.
- [x] **All visual elements styled using CSS** - Header, navigation, footer, cards, table, buttons, inputs, badges, and notification list all styled with custom CSS.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing using flexbox and/or grid display** - Flexbox used in header and login page; CSS grid used in dashboard (2-column) and about page (feature grid); media queries collapse layouts at 600px.
- [x] **Use of a imported font** - Nunito imported from Google Fonts and applied via font-family on all pages.
- [x] **Use of different types of selectors including element, class, ID, and pseudo selectors** - Element selectors (body, header, th, td, blockquote), class selectors (.card, .streak-badge, .welcome-banner), ID selectors (#logWater, #notifications, #treePlaceholder), and pseudo selector (nav a:hover).
- Personal note: when I update CSS, I just SSH in and run `/home/ubuntu/services/deploy-startup.sh` to pull and copy files into `/home/ubuntu/services/startup/public`.
